# anweb
Mini web backend framework in Rust.
Asynchronous, lightweight, high performance and fast compile.
Built on MIO crate.

Currently in draft development.

### Goals
To implement minimal sufficient functionality for developing secure, high-performance web servers.

### Example
```rust
    use anweb::server::{Event, Server};

    fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
        let addr = ([0, 0, 0, 0], 8080).into();
        let server = Server::new(&addr)?;

        server.run(|server_event| {
            if let Event::Incoming(tcp_session) = server_event {
                tcp_session.to_http(|request| {
                    request?.response(200).text("Hello world!").send();
                    Ok(())
                });
            }
        })?;

        Ok(())
    }
```

### Safety
100% safe rust code in this crate and has minimal dependencies on third-party crates with unsafe code.

### Perfomance
On Linux it's very fast.
